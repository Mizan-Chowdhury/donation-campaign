# 3 Project features

* I have created a Donation Trust page which has twelve donation fields in four categories. Clicking on each category card will show its details in another route. I have also added a functional search bar to the homepage. If the user enters a donation category in this search bar, only the cards of that category will be displayed.

* I have also created another route in my project which will show the cards that have been donated. If the donated cards are more than 4 then a See All button will show below. Then after clicking the See All button all the cards will show and the button will disappear

* I have also created a statistics route in my project which contains a pie chart. This pie chart will show the percentage of how much the user has donated and how much is left.
